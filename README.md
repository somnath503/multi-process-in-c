1. Parent and Child Process Messages

    Creates a child process using fork().

    Both parent and child print their own messages.

    Demonstrates how processes run independently after fork().

2. Parent Waits for Child

    Parent creates a child process.

    Parent waits for the child to complete using wait().

    Ensures child finishes before parent continues.

3. Alternate Number Printing with Pipes

    Uses two processes connected by a pipe.

    Parent and child print numbers alternately (e.g., parent prints even, child prints odd).

    Demonstrates inter-process communication with pipes.

4. Producer-Consumer Problem

    One process produces data, another consumes it.

    Uses pipes or shared memory for communication.

    Illustrates synchronization between processes.

5. CPU Scheduling Algorithms

    Simulates common CPU scheduling algorithms:

        -FCFS (First Come First Serve): Jobs are executed in order of arrival.

        -SJF (Shortest Job First): Jobs with shortest execution time run first.

        -Round Robin: Each job gets a fixed time slice in rotation.

    Helps understand how CPU manages multiple processes.
